    * Or have a ide where you can view the .ipynb file
2. Make sure you can run Python code
    * If not install Python

## Running the exercises file
1. Open a terminal in your JupyterHub or ide
2. Type in git clone https://github.com/laural888/version_control_group_lab.git and hit the enter 
3. This should download a folder to your JupyterHub/ide with the file (it should be called version_control_group_lab)
4. Double click the new folder in the file explorer. You should see the exercises file.
5. Launch the exercises.ipynb notebook.
6. Next run the code by clicking on the code cell and hitting shift + enter

## What the code does
First, the code prompts the user for their name.
Then, the code prompts the user for their age.
* If the user is 18, then the output is that the code is also 18.
* If the user is under 18, then the output states the person is young.
* If the user is over 18, then the outputs states the person is old.
